# Machine-Learning
Python code for commonly used Machine Learning algorithms
The perceptron.py file contains the code for a single layer perceptron. Synthetic data is generated. 
It is ensured that the two classes are linearly separable. The perceptron.py file containts the Perceptron class 
the learning occurs.
The training data.py file contains the data generation part and testing of the test data.
